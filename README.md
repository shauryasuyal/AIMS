# Data Preprocessing Techniques

This project demonstrates three fundamental data preprocessing techniques used in machine learning - Ordinal Encoding, One Hot Encoding, and Imputation, implemented using only basic Python, Pandas, and NumPy, without using predefined helper functions like get_dummies() etc. 

It is designed for beginners and students who want to understand the logic behind encoding and imputation rather than relying on built-in libraries. The project helps learners grasp how categorical data can be converted into numerical form and how missing data can be handled manually before feeding it into machine learning models.













## Additional Information

1. **Ordinal Encoding:**    

Converts categorical data into numerical form based on their inherent order.

This helps machine learning models interpret ordered data correctly.
The code dynamically detects unique categories and assigns increasing numerical values instead of hardcoding them.

2. **One Hot Encoding:**

Transforms categorical variables into binary columns for each unique category.
Each original category gets its own column, and rows are marked with 1 where the category is present.
This is useful when there is no inherent order among categories.
The code automatically finds all unique categories and encodes them dynamically.

3. **Imputation:**

Handles missing data by filling them with calculated values.
The code demonstrates mean, median and mode imputation.
This ensures that missing values donâ€™t interfere with data analysis or machine learning model training.



## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
python Ordinal Encoding.py
python One Hot Encoding.py
python Imputation.py

```
Each of the above scripts can be run individually in a terminal or IDE that supports Python 
Make sure you have **Python 3, Pandas, and NumPy** installed before running the scripts.

If required, install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy

```
